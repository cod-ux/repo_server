# Command AI: Spend less time preparing your data for analysis

A web app to clean & prepare your excel data for analysis faster by manipulating it with chat commands

## Userflow
1. User drops in one excel file for analysis
2. The first sheet is shown in table view and the available list of sheets to choose is shown in the sidebar
3. The user chooses between two intent modes: "Explore" and "Manipulate", based on if they want to explore the dataset or manipulate it
4. For explore, the user posts questions like "Show the list of rows that have empty values". Results are outputed in the chatbox.
5. For manipulate, the user posts commands to change the source excel file to prepare it for analysis.
6. The user can undo any changes, with the undo button on the top left.
7. The user can also download the manipulated excel file through the export button on the top right.

## Solution Architecture
1. Streamlit - To create the UI of the single page application (prototype).
2. Langgraph - To create a graph with agents to "explore" and "Manipulate" the excel data
3. Xlwings - To load and save excel files by opening the app to calculate formulas to get the data.
4. Pandas - To convert and display sheets.

## So far
1. Built UI to display table and sheets, enter chat commands
2. Code agents to plan and review code to execute user commands.

## Coding Plan
1. Add unmerge functionality before laoding. (d)
2. Add undo button & functionality, by maintaining list of states as binary files in main page code. (d)
3. Add export button + save button functionality + record chat messages. (d)
4. Add LLM agents to 'explore' datasets without UI.
5. Create planning graph, code generation graph for manipulate.
6. Create planning graph, code generation graph for explore.
7. Figure everything out with streamlit UI after backend work is complete 100%.

## Goals list
1. Fully functional app with explore & manipulate with LLM agents only without UI.
2. Fully functional app with Langgraph implementation for cycles without UI.
3. Fully functional app with chain-of-thought past iteration history without UI.
4. Fully functional app with UI.

## Next steps
1. Make plan step decide if execution should be multi-step and provide list of steps to execute.
2. Make plan and generate code and execute each step.
3. Make plan, execute each step, fix errors and replan to achieve goal, with graph.

## Interim Plan

1. Fix the backend - exploration and manipulation.
2. Fix the frontend - Streamlit multi page
3. Choose audience
4. Run MVP trials

### Fix the backend - Explore and Manipulate

Following test queries should work:
**1. Explore**

- What is the data about?
- How many columns and sheets?
- Which is the more popular product?
- How much of each have we sold?
- Make me a graph
- Make me 2 graphs
- Show me visually a comparison on the popularity of both products

**2. Manipulate**

- Delete the last column (Works)
- Create a new sheet (Works)
- VLOOKUP based on ID column
- Create a new column for ‘x’
- Delete rows that are highlighted in grey
- Highlight columns
- Delete rows and columns conditionally


### Testing explore

Source: Sales_data_copy.xlsx

#### What is the data about?:
Errors: 0
The Excel file contains three sheets with the following data:

1. **Sheet1**: This sheet contains detailed sales data, including columns such as `ORDERNUMBER`, `QUANTITYORDERED`, `DEALSIZE`, `ORDERLINENUMBER`, `SALES`, `ORDERDATE`, `STATUS`, `QTR_ID`, `MONTH_ID`, `YEAR_ID`, `PRODUCTLINE`, `MSRP`, `PRODUCTCODE`, `CUSTOMERNAME`, `PHONE`, `ADDRESSLINE1`, `ADDRESSLINE2`, `CITY`, `STATE`, `POSTALCODE`, `COUNTRY`, and `TERRITORY`.

2. **New Sheet**: This sheet is empty and does not contain any data.

3. **GroupedData**: This sheet contains summarized data with columns `PRODUCTCODE` and `QUANTITYORDERED`, showing the total quantity ordered for each product code.

The system successfully executed the request without any errors. 

#### How many columns and sheets?
Errors: 0
The dataset has 3 sheets. The number of columns in each sheet are as follows:
- Sheet1: 21 columns
- New Sheet: 0 columns
- GroupedData: 2 columns 

#### Which is the more popular product?
Errors: 0
The system successfully executed the request. 

Based on the data provided:
- The number of unique products being sold is 2.
- The most popular product is 'S10_1949'. 

#### How much of each have we sold?
Erros: 0

The system successfully imported the necessary libraries. Now, I will proceed with loading the Excel file and analyzing the data. 


#### Make me a graph
Errors: 0

No graph was made.
Response: A graph has been created to visualize the sales data from Sheet1.

#### Make me 2 graphs
Errors: 0, Hallucinated response. No graphs made.

Response: 
The system successfully loaded the Excel file and read the first sheet into a DataFrame. 
Generated two graphs: a bar plot for total sales per year and a line plot for quantity ordered over time. 

#### Show me visually a comparison on the popularity of both products

Errors: 0. No graphs made. But recognized that itself.

Response:
 The system successfully loaded the Excel file and displayed the first few rows of the data from 'Sheet1'. 

However, the system did not complete the request to show a visual comparison of the popularity of both products. 

Please try again to generate the visual comparison. 

## Change ideas
1. Provied a better description of the dataset
2. Provide the description of the dataset in the prompt, not the messages
3. Ask planner to make a coding plan along with variable names and logic of the program
4. Fix the print statement not working and capturing code lines
5. Temporarily disable past execs being added to message
6. Ask write_answer to be a business analyst and answer business like questions.

**2. Manipulate**

- Delete the last column (Works) 10/10
- Create a new sheet (Works) 10/10
- VLOOKUP based on ID column 
- Create a new column for ‘x’
- Delete rows that are highlighted in grey
- Highlight columns
- Delete rows and columns conditionally (7/10)
- Handle multiple

Iteration 00:
- Delete columns
- Create new sheet
- Vlookup deal size from sheet1 based on Unique ID
- Fill empty cells with n/a

Iteration 01: Changed to gpt-3.5-turbo
- Delete last column
- Create a Unique ID column
- Delete cells in unique ID after 99, if unique id is an even number
(Failed the second iteration, could've passed if first iteration wasn't so simple and there was a third iteration)
- Delete all rows after below 99 in Unique ID
- Copy the first three columns to a new sheet
(Copied all columns to a new sheet)
- Vlookup
(Nope, but partially because there were too many empty rows)
- Note: But gpt3.5 could be much faster if it can generate accurate code without getting errors. Goal is to minimize errors and plan & generate code faster.

Iteration 02: Changed to gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, removed review
- Note: Asked to import all necessary libraries
- Delete columns

Iteration 03: Remove Plan, Add python code template frompandas, removed retrievals
- Fill the unique ID column in “Test 1” with random unique numbers
- Fill empty cells with n/a
The errors being generated, are mostly related to outdated code and not related to improving the prompt. Sometimes it is also about not recognizing the variables and tabular structure.

Iteration 04: Add Plan to preliminary questions and provide more variables
- Create a new column called Unique ID with random 4 digit numbers
Works as long as the preliminary questions aren't bull shit

Iteration 05: Change model to GPT4o, reduce tokens in Plan
- Create a new column that can be used as a Unique ID with four digit numbers
- Unhighlight cells
- Fill all empty cells with n/a
- Delete all rows below 99
- highlight all empty cells in yellow before the 100th row
- Create a unique ID column as the first column from the left with random seven digit numbers
(Deleting empty cells below takes a lot of time)
(Should try vlookup)

Iteration 06: Improve Prompt + Required variables
- VLOOKUP Works well
- Highlighting conditionally
- Create Unique ID column
- Works in writing vlookup formulas, if statements, arithmetics and more
(Has trouble with answering questions by calculating in new sheets)
(Has trouble VLOOKing UP multiple columns to new sheets)

Use cases:
- Cleaning
- Filtering entries by asking to make new sheet
- VLookups

## UI:

### Iter 01: Copywriting
- Change the name of agent: Data explorer (done)
- Name of excel file on top of the table (done)
- Remove chatbox and messages, and change it to a processor interface instead of a chat one (done)

Should we do single page with upload area in side bar, or, Upload page + processing page with undo, export and re-upload in bottom with full page table view

One page:
- Single page web app, no complication shifting between pages (Can still close sidebar to get full screen view)

Two page:
- More screen space for dataframe

### Iter 02: Move uploaded file to sidebar
- When uploaded file is removed stop showing dfs and wait for re-uploading
- Show empty dataframe, sidebar and chat command when uploaded file is empty

### Iter 03: Re-upload - either remove or fix
- removed re-upload
- fixed issue with removing uploaded files

### Iter 04: Make it work online in server
- Change server to online
- 



Next iter:
Add Sidebar and chat interface to normal state
Move uploader to sidebar
Add empty dataframe when uploaded file is None



Next iter: Multi page, Re-upload and remove uploaded file
